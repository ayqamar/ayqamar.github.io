## To-Do List

As a beginner coder, I decided to challenge myself by creating a to-do list app. I started with a simple layout and used HTML/CSS to make it look clean and modern.

The JavaScript was the most challenging part, but I learned a lot about dynamically updating the task list and adding/editing/deleting tasks.

Overall, it was a great learning experience and I plan to add more features in the future.

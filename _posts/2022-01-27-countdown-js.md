# Countdown Timer

I created a countdown timer using JavaScript to add urgency to my website for limited-time sales or promotions. 

I used the Date object to set the countdown date and the setInterval function to update it every second. 

I then displayed the remaining time in an HTML element using a simple string concatenation.
